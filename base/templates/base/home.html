                <h4>My First part-time job as a Subject matter expert at Chegg </h4>
					<hr>
					<p> More than a year after writing my first Hello World program with c++ language i learnt how to solve problems through
                        data structures and basic of language i appeared for the role of subject matter expert at Chegg and was selected in may 2021
                    Basically i solve C++/C problems and conceptual problems on the related topics.   </p>

					<p>Before I knew it we transitioned from the old system and we're on to mine. My newbie self was now in charge of hosting hundreds of thousands of lab samples and supporting thousands of clients.</p>

					<p>From this you’ll see that I’m someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to 
                        figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

				<hr>
				<p>After almost two years of supporting my system at the lab I’m ready to learn something new. I'll collaborating and sharing my experience with others on my blog (SayHelloWorld.co) & youtube channel.</p>
				<p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
